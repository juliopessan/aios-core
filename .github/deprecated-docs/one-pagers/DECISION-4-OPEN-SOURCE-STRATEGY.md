# Decision #4: Open-Source Strategy
## One-Page Executive Summary

**Decision Date:** November 13, 2025
**Status:** ✅ APPROVED
**Investment:** $155K Year 1 → $1.745M Year 2 (seed round)
**Savings:** $437K vs original $592K upfront
**Validation Score:** 9.7/10 (evidence-based on 20 case studies)

---

## THE DECISION

**Approach:** Evidence-Based Hybrid (BMAD Year 1 → Supermemory Year 2)

**Year 1 (2026): Low-Cost Validation ($155K)**
- Q1: Epic 10-12 completion + hire 2 devs ($80K)
- Q2: Soft launch (Commons Clause) + Founding Partners ($10K)
- Q3: Partner validation ($31K)
- Q4: GO/NO-GO decision ($6K)
- **Target:** $15K+ MRR, 10K+ stars, 4 successful partners

**Year 2 (2027): Funded Scale ($1.5M-$2M seed)**
- Q1: Seed fundraising using Year 1 traction
- Q2-Q4: Build Partner Success Platform ($450K), scale to 100+ partners
- **Target:** $1M+ ARR by end of 2027

## 3 CRITICAL ADDITIONS (Post-Roundtable)

**Addition #1: Proprietary Partner Pack Requirement**
- Partners MUST own proprietary expansion packs (non-open-source)
- **Why:** Prevents HashiCorp failure (Terraform modules → AWS/Google free-ride)
- 70% partner / 30% AIOS revenue share
- Switching costs: Clients depend on partner's proprietary packs

**Addition #2: Partner Success Platform Differentiation**
- NOT "managed AIOS" → "Partner Success Platform"
- Features: Analytics dashboard, lead matching, white-label, revenue automation
- **Why:** Addresses Anyscale weakness (managed service only = 67% failure rate)
- Investment: $450K in Year 2 (Q2-Q4 2027)

**Addition #3: Competitive Timing Triggers**
- **TRIGGER A:** If Cursor/Windsurf announce partner program → fast-track launch
- **TRIGGER B:** If < 20 partners Q3 2026 → pivot to consulting (BMAD-style)
- **TRIGGER C:** If > 10 partners Q2 2026 → accelerate fundraising
- Daily monitoring: Google Alerts for Cursor/Windsurf announcements

## EVIDENCE BASE (20 CASE STUDIES)

**Success Patterns (14 companies, $100B+ combined valuation):**
| Company | Valuation | Success Pattern |
|---------|-----------|-----------------|
| LangChain | $1.25B | Framework → LangSmith (14mo to revenue) |
| Hugging Face | $4.5B | 5yr community → enterprise |
| Modal | $1.1B | Infrastructure quality first |
| Together AI | $305M | 10x faster inference |
| Midjourney | $100M+ ARR | Paid validation, bootstrapped |

**Failure Patterns (6 companies):**
| Company | Problem | Lesson |
|---------|---------|--------|
| Stability AI | Open Day 1, no revenue model | Validate revenue FIRST |
| HashiCorp | MIT license → forced BSL change | Commons Clause from Day 1 |
| Anyscale | Managed service only | Platform differentiation required |

**Moat Type Analysis:**
- **Data Gravity:** 100% success (Databricks)
- **Proprietary Platform:** 80% success (OpenAI, Modal, LangChain)
- **Network Effects:** 75% success (Replicate, Gradio, W&B)
- **Managed Service Only:** 33% success (Anyscale struggling)
- **Open-Source No Moat:** 0% success (Stability AI)

## REPOSITORY STRUCTURE (4 REPOS)

**PUBLIC (Distribution Strategy):**
```
aios/aios-core              (Commons Clause)
├── Core framework
├── 13 named agents
└── 2 free expansion packs

aios/expansion-packs        (MIT)
├── Community packs
└── Verified free packs

aios/mcp-ecosystem          (Apache 2.0)
├── 1MCP preset configurations
└── IDE setup automation
```

**PRIVATE (Capture Strategy):**
```
aios/certified-partners     (Proprietary)
├── Premium expansion packs (PROPRIETARY - prevents HashiCorp failure)
└── White-label assets

aios/mmos                   (Proprietary + NDA)
├── 34+ cognitive clones
└── MMOS platform
```

**Strategic Philosophy:**
> "Open-source the distribution layers (creates permissionless leverage).
> Protect the differentiation layers (captures value via defensible moats)."

## KILL SWITCHES (GO/NO-GO GATES)

| Quarter | Metric | Target | Action if Fail |
|---------|--------|--------|----------------|
| **Q1** | Test coverage | < 85% | DEFER launch |
| **Q2** | GitHub stars (2 weeks) | < 100 | Adjust positioning |
| **Q2** | Partners refuse proprietary terms | > 50% | Abort partner model |
| **Q3** | Partners report revenue | < 3/4 | NO-GO Year 2 |
| **Q3** | Proprietary packs | < 5 | Revisit terms |
| **Q4** | MRR | < $15K | Stay Year 1 model |
| **Q4** | GitHub stars | < 5K | Defer fundraise to Q2 2027 |
| **ANY** | Cursor announces partner program | - | Fast-track launch |

## RISKS & MITIGATION

**Community Doesn't Contribute:**
- **Probability:** MEDIUM (60% of OSS get <10 contributions)
- **Mitigation:** Revenue not dependent on community (certified partners model)

**Competitor Forks and Out-Executes:**
- **Probability:** LOW (30%)
- **Mitigation:** Commons Clause prevents commercialization, MMOS impossible to replicate

**Token Costs Drop 90%:**
- **Probability:** LOW (20%)
- **Mitigation:** MCP value shifts from "cost reduction" to "tool organization"

---

## SUCCESS METRICS

**Year 1 Validation Targets:**
- ✅ $15K+ MRR (Month 12)
- ✅ 10K+ GitHub stars
- ✅ 4 successful Founding Partners with revenue
- ✅ 20 proprietary packs (prevents HashiCorp failure)

**Year 2 Scale Targets:**
- ✅ $1M+ ARR
- ✅ 100+ partners

---

## STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT

**Aligns with:**
- Decision #3 (Founding Partners): Proprietary pack requirement critical

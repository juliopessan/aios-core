# Decision #3: Founding Partners Program
## One-Page Executive Summary

**Decision Date:** November 13, 2025
**Status:** ✅ APPROVED
**Investment:** $270K phased over 18 months
**Savings:** $40K vs original 5-tier program
**Target:** $735K ARR by Month 18 (2.7x ROI)

---

## THE DECISION

**Approach:** Phased Validation with 4 Pre-Identified Partners

**4 Founding Partners:**
1. **Alan Nicolas** - Education vertical (10K+ community)
2. **Taynã Puri** - Content vertical (already using AIOS in production)
3. **Steven Phil** - Enterprise vertical (government connections)
4. **Marco Marcelino** - Data vertical (non-technical specialist)

**3-Tier Model:**
- **Explorer (Free):** Try AIOS, no revenue share
- **Builder ($499/mo OR 30% share):** Certified partner, co-marketing
- **Legend (Earned):** Top performers, exclusive benefits

---

## WHY PHASED VALIDATION

**Problem with Original Plan (5-Tier Upfront):**
- $310K investment BEFORE validating demand
- Portal complexity might overwhelm early partners
- High risk if program fails

**Phased Approach (Founding Partners):**
- **Phase 0 ($5K, 30 days):** Validate partner interest
- **Phase 1 ($20K, 90 days):** Pilot with 4 partners, manual workflows
- **Phase 2 ($150K, 120 days):** Build Partner OS AFTER pilot succeeds
- **Phase 3 ($100K, 12 months):** Scale to 100 partners

**Kill Switches:** Day 30, 90, 210 (can abort if failing)

## FINANCIAL MODEL

**Investment Breakdown:**
| Phase | Duration | Investment | What Gets Built | Kill Switch |
|-------|----------|------------|-----------------|-------------|
| **Phase 0** | 30 days | $5K | Partner onboarding scripts, agreements | < 4/4 partners commit → ABORT |
| **Phase 1** | 90 days | $20K | ClickUp workspace, deal support, training | < 3/4 partners report revenue → NO-GO Phase 2 |
| **Phase 2** | 120 days | $150K | Partner OS MVP (analytics, revenue automation) | < 10 proprietary packs → abort marketplace |
| **Phase 3** | 12 months | $100K | Scale to 100 partners, marketplace launch | < $30K MRR → stay Year 1 model |

**Total: $270K phased (vs $310K original = $40K savings)**

**Revenue Projections:**
| Month | Partners | Avg Revenue/Partner | Total MRR | Total ARR |
|-------|----------|---------------------|-----------|-----------|
| 3 | 4 | $2,500 | $10K | $120K |
| 6 | 10 | $3,000 | $30K | $360K |
| 12 | 20 | $4,000 | $80K | $960K |
| 18 | 40 | $5,000 | $200K | **$2.4M** |

**Conservative Target: $735K ARR by Month 18**
**ROI:** $270K → $735K = 2.7x (15-16 month payback)
